# ISA Vehicle Detection Set Up

## Cloning this directory

git clone !!!!!!!!!

## Conda Environment
use ```conda activate ~/your env name or drectory```
make sure your python version >= 3.8

## Model Download

YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO THIS, but to cite the model, we ran
```
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
```
Therefore, please run 
```
cd ./yolov5/
pwd
```
make sure that you are in the yolov5 directory

then run  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all the neccessary library dependencies for the app

Now go into src directory and run the app:
```
cd ../src
python app.py
```
Or open the app.ipynb file and execute the code. Remember: opening the script inside of a jupyter notebook will not give you a pop-up window. Modern IDE adviced.
